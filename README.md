# Cassini Traceback

For [NaNoGenMo 2019][1].

**Warning:** This README contains **flashing images**, and this project outputs a file that
contains them.

How would a machine attempt to understand the actions of another machine, how would it tell the
story of another machine?

_Cassini Traceback_ is one machine trying to make sense of the actions of the [_Cassini_][2]
orbiter, whose incredible ~20-year mission ended with its atmospheric entry into Saturn. Taking as
its starting point the [human-written accounts][3] of its last orbits, the machine attempts to:

- parse the text related to each orbit, querying various sources for words and phrases that it
doesn't recognise; and
- querying the amazing [OPUS datastore][4] for visual data sent back to Earth by _Cassini_ during
that exact orbit, stitching it all into a single GIF.

The output is partly human-readable, partly machine-readable, studded throughout with image
sequences originally captured millions of kilometers from Earth by a machine built by a group of
primates from 28 different countries. You can see the output from my machine [here][5].

The program is only guaranteed to run on Python 3.7.x. Running it locally will take some time
because of all of the network requests involved, and I have not implemented any rate limiting so
please be respectful of the services involved.

In addition to installing everything that's in the requirements file you will also need to run
`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` and follow [the NLTK data installation instructions][6]
before you'll be able to run the program with a simple `python main.py`.
